In 1920, after he left the navy he set up a transport business in Terrington St Clement at the same time as Eddie Stobbart. While he ran the company, he supplied the whole country during the war.</div>
His son, Horis Human fought in the Second World War as a corporal in the desert rats and fought in Dunkirk, North Africa, Italy, France, Belgium, Holland and Germany as a tank transporter.  
  
The farm was bought for Horis by his father after the war in 1944. Grandad Horis started growing vegetables, salad and fruit. He Had livestock and started rearing turkeys and chicken in 1952. He then married Rhoda and in 1946, Michael Human was born, the younger brother of Auntie Pat.  
  
Dad (Michael) went on to help on the farm in 1963 and studied agriculture and welding at college, passing with full honors. Dad met Jean Shaw looking across a flower field on a friend's farm and married in 1974. They went on to have Sam in 1978 and me, Ben in 1980. 
  
In 1984, Grandad Horis died suddenly at the age of 64. Leaving Dad to run the farm, Mum (Jean) helped on the farm while we boys were young, later taking a step back from the farm and becoming a financial advisor.  
On the 1st of April 1989, everyone's lives changed forever… 
Sam was involved in a terrible accident whilst we were on a bike ride. He died virtually where the farm shop stands today, with help from friends and family everything continued and the farm continued to grow. Family time was so important to us and even more so now!  
  
After the heartbreak of losing Sam, the family pushed forward. Mum worked hard to become a financial advisor and help on the farm when she could and Dad carried on expanding the farm, building more glasshouses and developing the poultry business. He also taught many people to weld. This took him all over the country with the training board.  
  
<picture><source srcset="images/unknown2.webp" type="image/webp"><source srcset="images/unknown2.png" type="image/jpeg"><img src="images/unknown2.png" class="rounded float-start img2" alt="..." loading="lazy" width="auto" height="310px"></picture>After school, I helped on the farm but also worked for my best friend J.A.Collison and Sons for two years. I started there when I was 14 as weekend and after-school help. Here June, Phil, Diane and Ian Collison taught me many things for my future. They have always been true family friends and even to this day, they have been my best men and godparents to our children.  
  
In 2001, I was lucky to get through the recruitment process to join Tyne and Wear Fire Service where I served for two years before transferring back to Norfolk and serving at Kings Lynn on Blue, Green and White watches. To this day, 20 years after I started, I still serve as the Watch Commander of the on-call fire service at West Walton. 
  
When I came back home, I helped Dad with the farm and worked around the shift patterns. The farm grew and grew. The old farm was replaced and changed into a house, new buildings were built. I and Dad were growing flowers for supermarkets, veg and salads for markets and up to 4500 birds for the poultry market, even supplying the Queen. The farm continued to run as normal until in 2013 we decided not to replace an old wooden greenhouse, but diversify into a new venture… 
  
Between my shifts, partying and family time; the Human Family built what is now Samuels Family Farm Shop and Butchers. Named in memory of Samuel Human. Lots of help from Dad, friends and family made a dream happen. The doors opened on 18th April 2015..... 
  
Samuels Family Farm Shop and Butchers were born. We opened with 2 full-time staff and today we are nearly at 30 members of staff. 
We have had so many young people who we have given confidence and taught life skills too and this is our ethos, we invest in our staff and look after them like family.  
  
I then met Gemma who used to frequent the shop as a customer, and now she is so much more… My wife and the rest is history! 
Gemma works as a fitness instructor who has her studio on the farm and also works within the shop. She has supported the growth of our business and has worked tirelessly. 
  
We are so lucky to have four beautiful children. Ella, Ava, Ezra and Albie. 
You may often see them helping out in the shop and also their photo dotted around and handprints on the walls. 
  
In 2016, I left my position at the full-time fire service, but I remain on call. After finding it hard to juggle doing jobs on the farm, 45+ hour weeks with the fire service, building the shop and butchery and spending quality time with my family; I knew something had to give. 
  
In 2018, Samuels doubled in size as the demand was unprecedented. We also opened a coffee shop. Ran totally by our amazing Caroline who now holds the position of General Manager for the entire shop. She has now become part of our family and we are so grateful for her.   
  
Over the last two years, we have been building the newest development on the Human Farm, a Bar and Restaurant called Brothers In Arms! I have done nearly all the work myself, with a helping hand from friends and family. Including Harry, Gary, Graham, Connor and many more, I could name.  
  
While we were nearing completion we appointed Reece, General Manager of Brothers In Arms. He had been working in the farm shop and butchery so we asked him if he would like to take on this amazing role. He has been part of managing restaurants and bars locally, and internationally. We are so happy to have him at the helm of the new chapter of the family legacy.  We opened the doors on 4th June 2022 and the story is to be continued… 
  
Until then, I hope you enjoyed the history of Samuels and the Human family. We look forward to making new memories and hope you love what we have built as much as we do.
